# spiral-waveform

- For Polymer 1.0

Draws the time-domain representation of `AudioBuffer` which can be panned or zoomed by dragging the waveform horizontally or vertically. Amplitude-wise zooming can be done by dragging the amplitude ruler vertically.

It also supports multi-channel audio buffer and the view port can be scrolled when the contents overflow the specified size.

This is design to be used with `<spiral-minimap>`.
